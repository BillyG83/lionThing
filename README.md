# Description of functionality
This app is a timer / countdown maker.
The app allows you to make timers that count down to 0.
The applications has two inputs and a button
The first input is for text and allows you to name your timer.
The second input is for seconds and allows you to enter a length for your timer.
The create button makes a new timer as long as there is a title and an amount of seconds added.
When each timer is created it can be paused or fully removed by pressing the corresponding button on the timer.
Timers are green as they count down, turn yellow if paused and go red if they hit 0 and stop counting down.
